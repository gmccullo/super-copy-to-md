# Privacy Policy — Super Copy to Markdown

**Super Copy to Markdown** does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

- The extension reads the text you select on a webpage solely to convert it to Markdown and write it to your clipboard. This data never leaves your device.
- Your settings (line prefix and link style) are stored locally using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync across your own signed-in Chrome browsers. No settings data is sent to any external server.
- The extension has no analytics, no tracking, and communicates with no external services.
